* Description
Full Moon Matrimony is a MERN stack matrimonial platform that allows users to register and log in using Firebase Authentication to access protected routes and view user details. The platform facilitates partner searching based on gender, occupation, and permanent place. It leverages MongoDB as the database, React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, custom hooks for various functionalities, and Material UI for components.


1. User Authentication with Firebase
Firebase Authentication ensures secure registration and login processes for users. It provides a robust and scalable authentication mechanism, enabling users to create accounts and securely log in to access the platform's features and protected routes.

2. Advanced Partner Search
Users can perform advanced searches to find potential partners based on various criteria like gender, occupation, and permanent place. This feature enhances user experience by allowing them to filter and narrow down their search to find compatible matches more efficiently.

3. Premium Membership Requests
Users have the option to request admin approval for premium membership. Becoming a premium member grants access to exclusive features and privileges within the platform, enhancing the user's visibility and interactions.

4. Admin Approval Workflow
Admins have the authority to approve or reject premium membership requests. This workflow ensures that only verified users or those meeting specific criteria gain access to premium features, maintaining the platform's credibility and integrity.

5. Contact Information Requests
Non-premium users can request contact information for specific profiles by paying a nominal fee (500 BDT). After submitting the request, admin approval is required before contact details are shared, adding an additional layer of security and privacy protection.

6. JWT Token-based Security
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized for secure authentication and authorization processes. They provide a reliable method for verifying the authenticity of users and managing access to protected routes, ensuring data security throughout the platform.
